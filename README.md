# OSC-Assignment



You must include documentation to accompany your assignment. Therefore, write a brief
README file that has the following requirements:
• Must be written in Markdown syntax
• Must be named README.md
• Must be located in the base directory in your git repository
Your README.md file must contain:
9
IN616 – Operating Systems Concepts Bash Scripting Assignment
• Author details:
– Your full name
– You student code (aka. login name)
– A timestamp of last date when changes were made
• Project details for each of the two scripts:
– Summary of the purpose of the script
– Pre-requisites of running the script
– Instructions on how to run the script, including example commands
When writing your README file, think about the reader as someone who does not know the
instructions provided in this document. Make sure to write the documentation for someone
who has limited knowledge of the Linux operating system. Additionally, think of yourself half
a year down the road, and what documentation you will need
